## Description

My Custom Unity Package is a [brief description of your package]. This package provides [list of key features or functionalities] to enhance your Unity projects.

## Features

AutoBind
Automatically binds components to GameObjects, reducing manual setup time and ensuring that all necessary references are established at runtime. This feature streamlines the development process by eliminating the need for repetitive drag-and-drop operations in the Unity Editor.

CustomDebugger
A flexible debugging tool that enhances logging capabilities within your Unity project. It allows for easy logging of messages with various levels of severity (info, warning, error) and supports custom formatting. This feature helps developers quickly identify and resolve issues during development.

EventManager
A centralized system for managing events and notifications across your Unity project. This feature simplifies communication between different components by allowing them to subscribe and listen for specific events, promoting a decoupled architecture and improving code maintainability.

ObjectPool
An efficient object pooling system that minimizes the overhead of instantiating and destroying GameObjects at runtime. By reusing objects from a predefined pool, this feature enhances performance and reduces memory allocation, making it ideal for scenarios with frequent object creation and destruction.

Responsive
A responsive design feature that adjusts the layout and visual elements of the UI based on the screen size and resolution. This ensures a consistent user experience across various devices and resolutions, making it easier to create mobile-friendly and adaptable interfaces.

Singleton
A design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance, providing a global point of access. This feature is commonly used for managing game state, configuration settings, and other shared resources, ensuring that there is only one instance throughout the application's lifecycle.

UIChildCulling
An optimization feature that selectively enables or disables child UI elements based on their visibility in the viewport. This improves performance by reducing the rendering load for off-screen elements, allowing for smoother frame rates and a more efficient use of resources.
